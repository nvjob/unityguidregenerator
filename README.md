# Unity GUID Regenerator

Forcing a GUID to regenerate/refresh.

It works from Unity Editor itself and replaces all GUIDs to random ones. 
It also takes care of not replacing GUIDs for built-in resources. 
I does not requires any additional files, so it is pretty much a one click tool. To use it, call "Tools/Regenerate asset GUIDs" menu item.
